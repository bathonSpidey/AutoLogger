# AutoLogger
**Autonomous attendance logger designed and developed for the HSRW Robotics club. The Raspberry Pi uses face recognition to detect faces and recognise from existing database. Then, uses hand gesture detection to log in/out.**

Files are created daily to store check-in and check out of users with timestamps. The logging directory maintains a heirarchy based on year and month.

System currently requires keyboard to accept input/awake from sleep.

### TODO
- [ ] Automate new user creation process
- [ ] Make system completely hands-free
